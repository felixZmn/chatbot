## Installation

The "prooven" way to install the chatbot is via ansible on a linux system. The
alternative way is to install the chatbot manually. Therefore, the playbook can be
used as a reference. The installation playbook is located in the `infrastructure`
directory.

### Step By Step Guide

1.  Installing ansible:

        ```bash
        sudo apt install ansible
        ```

    If the connection to the server is established via ssh useranme and password instead
    of ssh key, the package `sshpass` must be installed additionally:

```bash
sudo apt install sshpass
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:felixZmn/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
```

3. Create an inventory file:

```yaml
ungrouped:
  vars:
    ansible_user: <username>
    # optional, if no ssh key is used
    ansible_ssh_pass: <password>
  hosts: 123.123.123.123
```

4. Execute the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
```

5. Post-Installation steps

- Create the discord bot in the Discord Developer Portal
- Add the bot token to the `.env` file
- Invite the bot to your Discord server using the OAuth2 URL generated in the Discord Developer Portal

## Adding and Managing Sources for RAG

To manage the sources for the bot which can be used by the bot to answer question the RAG solution is choosed. All files
to include to the vector store must be placed in the **data/[course]** folder. For each course one **sources.json** is
needed. This file has the structure shown below:

```
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "priority": 1,
      "name": "Leitlinien Studium",
      "file": "Leitlinien.pdf",
      "description": "Informationen über die Studienordnung, Prüfungen",
      "web_link": "https://daten.de/Leitlinien.pdf"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| priority    | Manipulates the "Similarity Score" used for ranking documents. Default value is **1**. This value represents an unchanged priority.<br>The Similarity Score (value from 0-1) is multiplied by this value.                               |
| name        | Understandable human-readable identifier of the document.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| file        | Exact specification of the filename with file extension.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| description | Brief description of the content of this file. When should one look into this file?                                                                                                                                                     |
